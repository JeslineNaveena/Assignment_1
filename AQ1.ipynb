Investigate the relationships between your features and how they are distributed. Make sure the data you use reflects the issue you are attempting to solve.\n",

Depending on whether you're working on a classification, regression, or other type of problem, this could involve accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, or other metrics. To determine how much improvement is required, compare your model's performance to baseline models or earlier iterations.\n",

To determine the best set of hyperparameters for your model, conduct a systematic search or use methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimisation.\n",

        "6.Cross-validate your model to determine how well it generalises to new data. Consider utilising regularisation approaches like L1 or L2 regularisation, dropout, or early stopping to reduce overfitting and increase generalisation if your model is overfitting (doing well on training data but badly on test data).\n",

Periodic retraining or reevaluation of the model may be necessary due to changes in the data distribution or the problem domain. Keep current with the latest methods, formulas, and industry standards.\n",
